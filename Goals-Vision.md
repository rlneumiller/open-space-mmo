# 0. Don't forget the fun.

## 1. Open source like there's a tomorrow

We practice open source development where code contributions are truly open, enabling anyone to build, modify, and innovatewhile being assured that their work won't be taken private or hidden behind a paywall. Creative contributions—from artwork and music to dialog and mission designs—are protected under non-commercial licensing by default, respecting artists' creative ownership while still enabling community collaboration. Contributors can always choose more permissive licensing for their work.

## 2. **Inclusive Community**

- **Welcoming Culture:** We have a clear code of conduct and contributor guidelines to make it easy for newcomers to get involved, regardless of skill level.

- **Accessible Tech:** Avoid requiring special hardware, paid services, or crypto wallets. Design for low-end devices and global connectivity.
- **Diverse Voices:** Encourage contributions from all communities that align with our core tenets.

## Non-Profit Model

We're committed to a **non-profit model** that ensures open access and prioritizes our community.

### No Cryptocurrency or Tokenomics

We'll **avoid involvement in cryptocurrency, tokens, coins, or other financial incentives** that could be seen as sketchy, profit-driven or exclusionary. Our focus remains solely on the project's accessibility and the benefits that it can provide to our community.

---

### Community-Driven Funding

We're building this project on the principle of **open access**: it will **never be paywalled or directly monetized**. Our goal is to provide a free and accessible experience for everyone.

We're fully open to supporting avenues for those involved in the creative aspects of our project to gain recognition and **community-supported compensation** for their contributions when we have the means and it makes sense to do so.

To ensure the long-term health and growth of the project, we'll rely on a variety of **transparent funding methods** that resonate with our community's ethos. This includes community donations, crowdfunding efforts, Patreon, grants, and ethical, no-strings-attached sponsorships. We're open to any funding channel that upholds our values and supports our mission.

We welcome support from individuals and organizations who share our commitment to open, community-driven development. Corporate donors are invited to contribute as partners in building a sustainable, creative ecosystem—not as a means to extract value at the community’s expense. Our licensing and governance policies are designed to ensure that all contributions, whether from individuals or corporations, serve the long-term interests of the community.

- **Governance:** Intially we'll be governed by yours truly (BDFN) with the goal of establishing a democratic decision-making process. We'll figure out together what makes sense, be it a foundation or some other cooperative structure if the project grows large enough to warrant such.

## 4. **Encourage decentralization**

**Leverage distributed compute and storage:** Embrace hybrid peer-to-peer architectures that combine reliable coordination with the scalability of distributed networks. Players can contribute to the universe's infrastructure by lending neighbors a cup of bits — whether hosting a star system, calculating jump routes, streaming ship assets, or processing local physics. This transforms infrastructure participation into another meaningful way to contribute to the project, creating a truly community-owned universe that scales with its players rather than against them.

## 5. **Ethical Tech Choices**

- **Privacy:** Respect user data and privacy. No trackking or analytics without transparent prior consent with configurable reminders.

- **Sustainability:** Optimize for energy, resource (e.g: distributed compute\storage) and financial efficiency.

### Example Stack

- **Networking:** The usual cloud for the performance\latency critial bits and WebRTC, Matrix bridge from Discord if necessary), custom peer-to-peer protocols
- **Storage:** IPFS, Dat, or open distributed filesystems
- **Compute:** Volunteer compute frameworks (like BOINC) or federated learning for personalized AI NPCs or Companions, without tokens or financial rewards
- **Community:** Discourse forums, Matrix chat, GitHub/GitLab for code (maybe discord)

---

**Bottom line:**
Build a thriving, open, and non-profit MMO with distributed tech—without touching crypto or profit-driven models. Hopeful that this approach will attract contributors who care about the mission and want to make something awesome together.
