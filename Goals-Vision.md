## 2. **Inclusive Community**

- **Welcoming Culture:** Write a clear code of conduct and contributor guidelines. Make it easy for newcomers to get involved, regardless of skill level.
- **Accessible Tech:** Avoid requiring special hardware, paid services, or crypto wallets. Design for low-end devices and global connectivity.
- **Diverse Voices:** Proactively invite contributions from underrepresented groups and regions.


## 3. **Non-Profit Model**

- **No Tokenomics:** Avoid tokens, coins, or any financial incentives that could be seen as profit-driven or exclusionary.
- **Funding:** If you need funds, rely on transparent donations (e.g., OpenCollective, Patreon), grants, or sponsorships—never paywalls or monetization schemes.
- **Governance:** Use open, democratic decision-making. Consider a foundation or cooperative structure if the project grows large.


## 4. **Decentralized, But Not Crypto-Dependent**

- **Distributed Compute/Storage:** Use peer-to-peer tech (like IPFS for storage or WebRTC for networking) that doesn’t require blockchain or tokens.
- **Federated Models:** Look at how Mastodon or Matrix operate: independent servers (or “instances”) that interoperate, letting communities self-host and govern.


## 5. **Ethical Tech Choices**

- **Privacy:** Respect user data—no tracking, no analytics without consent.
- **Sustainability:** Optimize for energy efficiency and minimal resource use.

### Example Stack

- **Networking:** WebRTC, Matrix, or custom peer-to-peer protocols
- **Storage:** IPFS, Dat, or open distributed filesystems
- **Compute:** Volunteer compute frameworks (like BOINC) or federated learning, without tokens or financial rewards
- **Community:** Discourse forums, Matrix chat, GitHub/GitLab for code

---

**Bottom line:**
You can absolutely build a thriving, open, and non-profit MMO with distributed tech—without touching crypto or profit-driven models. This approach will attract contributors who care about the mission and want to make something awesome together. If you want examples or more details on any of these points, just ask!
