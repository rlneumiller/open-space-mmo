## 🤖 Automation as Agency

**Core Concept**: Allow players to automate repetitive or non-critical tasks — just like you’d script them in real life — provided they manage the trade-offs: system upkeep, software complexity, performance degradation, etc.

### 🌌 Automation Domains

Here are high-value areas you could automate with meaningful consequences:

| Domain         | Example Tasks                                     | Automation Hooks                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Spaceflight**| Interplanetary travel, station docking, autopilot re-entry | Nav AI modules, orbital autopilot chips |
| **Logistics**  | Resource hauling, trade route repetition, cargo sorting | Drone convoys, trade macros            |
| **Agriculture**| Crop cycles, irrigation, pest control             | Climate-control terraforming pods      |
| **Mining**     | Scanning, drilling, material separation           | Mining subroutines, risk-assessment AI |
| **Maintenance**| System diagnostics, patching, resupply routines   | Fabricators, patchdrones, repair beacons|
| **Research**   | Long-duration simulations, data parsing           | Compute node daemons, archive bots     |

### 🔧 Gameplay Systems

- **Custom Automation Scripts**: Players can create or buy "automation profiles" — editable behaviors (like recipes) with parameters.
- **Wear & Tear Balance**: Automation may be *faster* but applies passive wear; manual actions offer more finesse or efficiency.
- **Skill vs Scale**: Manual actions might yield “perfect results” (e.g. bonus harvest, smoother landing) while automation handles bulk.
- **Energy/Heat Budgeting**: Automated processes consume more power or generate heat — adding a strategic layer to when/how they’re used.
- **Upgradeable Routines**: Basic automation does the job. Advanced modules (rare or crafted) improve speed, precision, or AI decision-making.

### 🎮 Player Experience Hooks

- **Build-A-Bot System**: Let players design helper drones, programmable through modular hardware and software loadouts.
- **Script Marketplace**: Community-generated automation templates that players can share, modify, or monetize in-game.
- **Narrative Integration**: Certain factions may shun automation as “decay of discipline” while others revere it as “ascension through delegation.”

### 🪐 Lore Flavor

> “In the old days, the pilot *flew*. Now? You tell the ship where, cross your fingers the software remembers how, and hope maintenance bots fixed the heat shield last cycle.”

Include low-cost\legacy ships that *can’t be automated or only allow limited use — prized by purists but hard to master — and others that are full-AI nav systems you barely touch.
