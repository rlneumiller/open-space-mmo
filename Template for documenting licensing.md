# I need a template for documenting this

Absolutely! Here’s a simple, clear template you can use for your project’s licensing documentation. This template makes it easy for contributors and users to see which licenses apply to which parts of your project.

# Project Licensing Overview

Welcome to the [Project Name]! We believe in openness and creative freedom. Here’s how licensing works for our project:

---

## 1. Code License

All source code in this repository is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE).
This means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code, including for commercial purposes, as long as you include the original copyright and license notice.

---

## 2. Asset Licenses

Game assets (artwork, music, sound, etc.) are contributed under licenses chosen by their creators.
**Each asset or asset pack includes a `LICENSE.txt` file specifying its license.**
If you use or redistribute assets, please check and follow the terms in the relevant `LICENSE.txt`.

### Asset License Table

| Asset Name/Folder | Contributor | License Type | License File |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `assets/space_ship_1/` | Jane Doe | CC BY 4.0 | `assets/space_ship_1/LICENSE.txt` |
| `assets/alien_music/` | John Smith | CC BY-NC 4.0 | `assets/alien_music/LICENSE.txt` |
| `assets/planet_textures/` | Alice Example | CC0 (Public Domain) | `assets/planet_textures/LICENSE.txt` |

*If you are contributing assets, please include a `LICENSE.txt` in your asset folder specifying your chosen license.*

## 3. Contributing

- **Code:** By contributing code, you agree to license your contributions under the MIT License.
- **Assets:** By contributing assets, you agree to clearly state your chosen license in a `LICENSE.txt` file within your asset folder.
