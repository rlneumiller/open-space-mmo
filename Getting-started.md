How to attract community support for an open-source Space MMO project.
Build a thriving open-source community through clarity, inclusivity, and steady engagement.

## Key Strategies for Attracting Community Support

**1. Define a Clear, Compelling Vision**
- Articulate what makes your project unique and why it matters. Even a simple, honest mission statement helps attract like-minded contributors who share your passion.
- Share your personal motivation—people are often drawn to authentic stories and clear goals.

**2. Start Small and Document Everything**
- Begin by publishing your code and documentation on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Clear, beginner-friendly documentation lowers the barrier for new contributors.
- Include a roadmap and contribution guidelines so others know how to help.

**3. Create a Welcoming, Inclusive Environment**
- Establish a Code of Conduct to foster a respectful and inclusive community.
- Recognize all contributions, no matter how small—gratitude goes a long way in open source.

**4. Use Community Hubs That Suit Your Style**
- Set up a central hub (forum, Discord, or even a GitHub Discussions page) where people can gather and ask questions.
- You don’t have to be constantly present—just check in regularly and respond thoughtfully.

**5. Leverage Asynchronous Communication**
- Use platforms that don’t require real-time interaction, like forums, mailing lists, or GitHub Issues. This suits introverted and retired developers who prefer thoughtful, paced communication.

**6. Invite Feedback and Participation**
- Ask for feedback on features, bugs, and ideas. People love to feel involved, and open calls for help are often met with enthusiasm in the open-source world.
- Organize occasional community events or challenges, but keep them simple and low-pressure.

**7. Recognize and Empower Others**
- Publicly thank contributors and, as the project grows, empower trusted community members to take on moderation or leadership roles.
- This helps share the workload and keeps the community vibrant.

## Additional Tips

- Let your project and documentation do most of the talking. Many contributors are happy to jump in if the codebase is accessible and the vision is clear.
- Don’t be afraid to ask for help — many open-source communities are full of people eager to contribute and mentor newcomers.
