# Code of Conduct

_This Code of Conduct is based on the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), which is adapted from the [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)._

## Our Pledge

We as participants, members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of preferred programming language, age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on building an exceptional space MMO experience.

## Our Mission

We are united in creating an immersive, engaging space MMO that brings players together across the galaxy. While our game may feature conflict, competition, and complex political dynamics in the virtual universe, our development community maintains respectful, collaborative, and constructive interactions at all times. Every contribution—whether code, art, documentation, or ideas—helps build something greater than any of us could create alone.

## Our Standards

In this community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better — remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow project participants comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to bring the project to life. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

### General Community Guidelines

* Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Avoid using language or metaphors that reference historical oppression or sensitive social issues. Please be mindful of the impact your words may have on others and consider alternative terminology when discussing challenging topics.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

### Development-Specific Guidelines

**Code Contributions & Reviews**
* Provide constructive, specific feedback in code reviews. Focus on the code, not the person.
* When submitting pull requests, include clear descriptions of changes and their impact on gameplay or performance.
* Respect different coding styles and architectural approaches. Present technical arguments professionally.

**Game Design Discussions**
* When discussing game mechanics, balance, or feature implementations, base arguments on player experience, technical feasibility, and project goals.
* Acknowledge that game design involves subjective elements. Present your perspective while remaining open to alternatives.
* Focus on solutions rather than just identifying problems. If you critique a system, suggest improvements.

**Asset Contributions**
* Respect intellectual property rights. Only contribute original work or properly licensed assets.
* Provide appropriate attribution for any third-party resources used in development or documentation.
* When reviewing art, sound, or other creative contributions, offer constructive feedback that helps improve the work.



**Player Privacy & Data**
* Never share player data, analytics, or personal information obtained through development access.
* Respect the privacy of other contributors and community members.
* Follow all applicable data protection guidelines when working with player information.

### Community Spaces



**GitHub Discussions**
* Stay on topic within discussions. Create new discussion threads for separate concerns.

**Social Media & External Platforms**
* When representing the project externally, maintain the same standards of respect and professionalism.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding [our community's standards of conduct](#our-standards). If you feel that an issue needs moderation, please contact the maintainers.

1. Remarks that violate the community standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner).
2. Remarks that maintainers find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Maintainers will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "blocked," i.e., blocked from the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Maintainers may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a maintainer bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that maintainer, or with a different maintainer, in private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
8. Maintainers are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a maintainer creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

### Special Considerations for Game Development

**Development Access**: Contributors with access to development servers or player data are held to additional standards of responsible use.

**Community Leadership**: As our project grows, some community members may take on informal leadership roles. These individuals are expected to model exemplary behavior and help maintain community standards.

**External Representation**: When discussing the project in external forums, streams, or social media, remember that you represent our community. Maintain professionalism and respect for all participants in the broader gaming community.

## Scope

The enforcement policies in this code of conduct apply to all official project venues, including code repositories, community forums, development streams, playtesting sessions, and any other official project spaces or events.

## Questions & Feedback

If you have questions about this Code of Conduct or suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or contact the maintainers directly. We view this document as a living guide that should evolve with our community.
