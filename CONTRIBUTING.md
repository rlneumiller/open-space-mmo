# Contributing to Open Space MMO

Welcome! 🌌 We’re building more than just a game — we’re creating a community and a universe together. Whether you're fixing typos, designing alien lifeforms, contributing code, or shaping gameplay mechanics, you're part of something meaningful.

## ✨ Our Vision

This project is fueled by the belief that immersive, inclusive, ethical worlds are worth building — both in-game and in development. We're developing a space MMO under a community-first philosophy that resists exploitative corporate interests and encourages cooperation, creativity, and equitable participation.

## ✨ Let's Build a Universe
